# Data Plant

## Overview

Data Plant is an opinionated concept-first data centric approach to machine learning operations.

> "**Implementation is solely a means to an ends**."

## Concepts

### [Data Analysis](data-analysis)
Inspects data for useful information and conclusions.

__Install__
```sh
helm install data-analysis ./data-analysis
```

__Delete__
```sh
helm delete data-analysis
```

### [Data Cleaning](data-cleaning)
Fixes or removes incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data.

__Install__
```sh
helm install data-analysis ./data-analysis
```

__Delete__
```sh
helm delete data-analysis
```

### [Data Evaluation](data-evaluation)
Determines whether data is usable.

__Install__
```sh
helm install data-analysis ./data-analysis
```

__Delete__
```sh
helm delete data-analysis
```

### [Data Extraction](data-extraction)
Retrieves subsets of data for further processing.

__Install__
```sh
helm install data-analysis ./data-analysis
```

__Delete__
```sh
