# Data Plant

## Overview

What is Data Plant?

Data Plant is an opinionated concept-first approach to deliver data centric machine learning operations.

Our mission is to conceptualize loosely coupled abstract data processes. 

We believe value is inherently derived through sharing `ideas`, `successes`, and `failures`.

## Concepts

* [Data Analysis](data-plant/data-analysis) inspects data for useful information and conclusions.


* [Data Cleaning](data-plant/data-cleaning) fixes or removes incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data.


* [Data Evaluation](data-plant/data-evaluation) determines whether data is usable.


* [Data Extraction](data-plant/data-extraction) retrieves subsets of data for further processing.


* [Data Collection](data-plant/data-collection) is the gathering and measuring targeted data from one or more sources.


* [Data Metadata](data-plant/data-metadata) summarizes information about other data.


* [Data Preparation](data-plant/data-preparation) manipulates data into a usable form.


* [Data Query](data-plant/data-query) answers a question. 


* [Data Splitting](data-plant/data-splitting) is the partitioning of data.


* [Data Storage](data-plant/data-storage) records data for future retrieval.


* [Data Transformation](data-plant/data-transformation) converts one data format to another.


* [Data Validation](data-plant/data-validation) checks the accuracy and quality of source data.
