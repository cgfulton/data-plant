# ML Plant

## Overview

What is Data Plant?

Data Plant is an opinionated machine learning concept-first approach to deliver data centric machine learning operations.

Our goal is to define data processes using abstract constructs. 

We believe that value is inherently derived through `ideas` and that a `implementations` are solely **Means To An Ends**.

## Data Concepts

### Data Analysis

[Data Analysis](./data-analysis) inspects data for useful information and conclusions.

### Data Cleaning

`Data Cleaning` fixes or removes incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data.

### Data Evaluation

`Data Evaluation` determines whether data is usable.

### Data Extraction

`Data Extraction` retrieves subsets of data for further processing.

### Data Collection

`Data Collection` is the gathering and measuring targeted data from one or more sources.

### Data Metadata

`Data Metadata` summarizes information about other data.

### Data Preparation

`Data Preparation` manipulates data into a usable form.

### Data Query

`Data Query` answers a question. 

### Data Splitting

`Data Splitting` partitioning data.

### Data Storage

`Data Storage` records data for future retrieval.

### Data Transformation

`Data Transformation` converts one data format to another data format.

### Data Validation

`Data Validation` checks the accuracy and quality of source data.
