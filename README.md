# ML Plant

## Overview

What is ML Plant?

ML Plant is an opinionated machine learning concept-first approach to deliver machine learning operations.

Our goal is to define machine learning operational processes using high level abstract concepts. 

We believe that true value is inherently derived from concepts with implementation being solely a means to an ends.

## Data Concepts

### Data Analysis

`Data Analysis` inspects data for useful information and conclusions.

### Data Cleaning

`Data Cleaning` fixes or removes incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data.

### Data Evaluation

`Data Evaluation` determines whether data is usable.

### Data Extraction

`Data Extraction` retrieves subsets of data for further processing.

### Data Collection

`Data Collection` is the gathering and measuring targeted data from one or more sources.

### Data Metadata

`Data Metadata` summarizes information about other data.

### Data Preparation

`Data Preparation` manipulates data into a usable form.

### Data Query

`Data Query` answers a question. 

### Data Storage

`Data Storage` records data for future retrieval.

### Data Transformation

`Data Transformation` converts one data format to another data format.

### Data Validation

`Data Validation` checks the accuracy and quality of source data.
